                RPC-Heat-Kubernetes delivers a deployable configuration of Kubernetes using CoreOS, Etcd, Fleet, and Flannel via OpenStack Orchestration (heat), available in any Rackspace OpenStack Private Cloud.

                RPC-Heat-Kubernetes (a.k.a Corekube) is a Heat template for OpenStack that creates the necessary infrastructure as well as configures it accordingly to deploy and host a Kubernetes cluster.

                The main pillars of Corekube's mission can be categorized into the following:

                Infrastructure (a.k.a "infra") - Includes the creation, provisioning and installation of the underlying cloud infrastructure and tools required to setup a Kubernetes cluster.
                Discovery - Utilizes Etcd to enable a private discovery service amongst the servers.
                Overlord - The deployment logic that consumes the infrastructure created, as well as the cluster information coordinated by the 'Discovery' node, to deploy Kubernetes onto the servers.

                With a deployment driven by OpenStack Orchestration, we are able to deliver a Kubernetes stack.

                The Overlord provisions all nodes with the appropriate metadata, vanilla image or not, directly into the existing or new Kubernetes cluster
            - >
                Numerous Kubernetes minion (nodes) are deployed to create a great foundation for a proof-of-concept Kubernetes cluster
            - >
                Network isolation isolation at various levels within the stack provide enhanced Cloud security.
